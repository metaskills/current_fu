# CurrentFu: The most evil gem you will hate to love.

CurrentFu gives a standard interface to the current controller instance in your models with automatic delegation to #current_* named methods.


## Installation

Install the gem with bundler. We follow a semantic versioning format that tracks Rails' minor version. So this means to use the latest 3.2.x version of CurrentFu with any 3.2 Rails version.

```ruby
gem 'current_fu', '~> 3.2.0'
```


## Testing

Simple! Just clone the repo, then run `bundle install` and `bundle exec rake`. The tests will begin to run. We also use Travis CI to run our tests too. Current build status is:
